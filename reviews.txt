Came for a quick drink at Taco Bell.
Mountain Dew Baja Blast even sweet is pretty good.
Plenty of parking spots.
Easy to find.
Clean and comfortable ambiance.
Will come again.
This Taco Bell location is in a small lot with shared parking.
We usually go inside because the drive‑thru is a bit awkward.
It takes awhile inside compared to the drive‑thru.
Not my favorite location but we stop if we are craving it.
I only like their crunchy tacos here.
Drive‑thru experience was decently fast.
The bean and cheese burrito was decent.
This spot is usually pretty fire. Being fans of Taco Bell and hyped after they announced their new menu line up for 2024, we wanted to try the cheesy chicken crispanada, and it was a little underwhelming. I would describe it as a fancier hot pocket. It wasn't bad necessarily, it just had the crunchy coat on the outside and the cheesy chicken gunk (best way to describe it) on the inside. Not bad, but not their best item and hopefully more better options to come. Also the drive through person was super blunt and borderline rude for no reason but hey maybe they were having a bad day
Crunch supreme was good.
They gave ample hot sauces.
It's Taco Bell so I wasn't expecting much.
Worst Taco Bell ever.
I ordered on the app at noon and didn't get my food until 12:40 PM.
Someone who walked in after me got their food before I did.
They kept telling me they were working on my order.
Don't offer mobile ordering if you can't have orders ready.
I only had six items but it felt like I was waiting for 1000.
They didn't include any hot sauce packets.
I even found a bone in my food.
Overall horrible establishment.
Wish I could give this place zero stars.
I ordered two items for breakfast and usually it's quick.
I walked in and all the staff was sitting down.
There was no one in the kitchen.
So I just walked out.
A baddie gave me some fire chicken tenders.
Ten out of ten service.
Amazing ambiance.
Loved the spicy ranch.
Will come back for my wedding.
I ordered one bean and cheese burrito and found a wood splinter inside.
It was about an inch long and absolutely disgusting.
What if a child had gotten it?
This is a choking hazard.
Workers don't care one bit.
No wonder they have two stars.
Do better.
Taco Bell gets my order wrong and then sends me a coupon.
When I tried to use the coupon the app said it was already used.
The employees and app makers suck at their job.
It's time to let Taco Bell die a slow death.
I'm moving on to businesses that actually care.
Waited over thirty minutes for a simple dine‑in order.
It wasn't even busy.
They only care about pumping drive‑thru orders.
We were excited to try the cheesy chicken crispanada.
It tasted like a fancier hot pocket.
Crunchy on the outside with cheesy chicken filling inside.
Not bad but not their best item.
The drive‑through person was blunt and rude.
Maybe they were having a bad day.
Using the kiosks was awkward and confusing.
Staff rudely told people to read the ticket.
Iced coffee melted and burrito came unwrapped.
We felt like we were inconveniencing the staff.
We'll never go back.
I ordered six items and the chicken quesadilla was missing.
The bag was sealed so I couldn't check.
They should make sure orders are complete.
Crap, crap, crap.
The drive‑thru wait was hella long.
They can't take orders at the mic and deliver them.
I literally eat Taco Bell once a year.
At night the service is quick and fast.
The staff is super nice.
An employee yelled at me for wearing a mask.
The place was short‑staffed and rude.
They obviously treat customers poorly.
Delivery took more than an hour even though I live seven minutes away.
My Crunchwraps were missing.
They gave me a $10 credit instead of a refund.
Food was soggy and customer service terrible.
In person they take more than fifteen minutes for small orders.
They are slow and inconsistent.
Denise Villanueva saved me from villains in the parking lot.
She served me the best Cheez‑It Crunchwrap Supreme ever.
Hands down the best customer service I have ever received.
She makes the best Baja Blast freezes.
Shoutout to Denise, best Taco Bell worker in the world.
I've been here many times and the food is always thirty minutes late.
Today they forgot my order entirely.
I was late to something important because of them.
Taco Bell was a staple during my college years.
It brings me great memories.
Need fast food late at night? Go to Taco Bell of course.
Crunchwrap supreme is my ultimate favorite.
It's my go‑to meal for a fast food Mexican craving.
My husband loves the Crunchwrap supreme and cheesy gordita crunch.
You can't go wrong with all that cheesy goodness.
They had a 5 for $5 deal but there was no excuse for the drive‑thru wait.
I stood in line and waited forty‑three minutes for my order.
Saul hooked us up with a lot of fire sauce.
The order was taken quickly and we got our items fast.
Super nice guy.
The fire sauce makes or breaks the Taco Bell experience.
Food is edible but nothing special.
